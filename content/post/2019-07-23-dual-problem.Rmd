# Lagrange dual problem

$$
\begin{array}{c}
{\text { maximize } \psi_{D}(\boldsymbol{\lambda}, \boldsymbol{\nu})} \\ 
{\text { subject to } \boldsymbol{\lambda} \geq \mathbf{0}}
\end{array}
$$

## Weak and Strong Duality

### 1.Weak duality: $d^{\star} \leq p^{\star}$ 


+  always holds (for convex and nonconvex programs)

+  can be used to find nontrivial lower bounds for difficult problems


### 2.Strong duality: $d^{\star} = p^{\star}$

+ does not hold in general

+ (usually) holds for convex problems

+ conditions that guarantee strong duality in convex problems are
called _constraint qualifications_
